**OrderUp** is an on-demand food **pre-ordering app** designed to eliminate the everyday friction of dining in and takeout experiences. Built as a collaborative capstone project, it connects restaurants and customers through a seamless mobile-first platform that prioritizes **speed, simplicity, and convenience**.

Instead of waiting in long queues or for a bill, customers can **pre-order their meals**, **pay in advance**, and have their food **ready on arrival**. Whether dining in or picking up, OrderUp enhances the restaurant experience by making it **fast, smooth, and time-conscious**.

## Project Vision

To automate the food ordering process and make it simple, convenient, and efficient for:
- **Customers** who want to enjoy a restaurant meal without the wait.
- **Restaurants** looking to manage peak times better.
- **Admins** who oversee user and order flows on the platform.

Our goal: Cut in half the time spent in restaurants by simplifying the flow from discovery → ordering → pickup → dine-in.

## Key Problems Solved

- Long waiting times for meal preparation
- Delays in receiving the bill
- Limited break times for working individuals
- Order congestion during peak hours

OrderUp solves this by **allowing users to place orders ahead of time**, ensuring food is ready the moment they arrive.
